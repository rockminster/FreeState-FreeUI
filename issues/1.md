### Issue: ESLint Job Failure

The ESLint job is failing due to missing or misconfigured @typescript-eslint dependencies. The specific error is that the "@typescript-eslint/recommended" config cannot be found as referenced in `packages/eslint-config/index.js`.

### Solution
1. Add `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` as devDependencies in the root `package.json`.
2. Run `pnpm install` or `npm install` to install the new dependencies.

### Proposed Changes
- Update `package.json` in the root directory.
- Ensure that the necessary ESLint configurations are correctly set up.
